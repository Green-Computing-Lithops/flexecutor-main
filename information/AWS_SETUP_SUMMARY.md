# FlexExecutor AWS Setup Summary

## Current Status

‚úÖ **FlexExecutor Successfully Configured and Executed Locally**
- FlexExecutor is properly installed and configured
- Monte Carlo Pi estimation example executed successfully using local configuration
- Generated comprehensive profiling data with energy monitoring
- Execution completed in 128.77 seconds with 10 workers
- All 10 workers completed successfully (100% completion rate)

## AWS Configuration Issue

‚ùå **AWS Credentials Expired**
The AWS credentials provided in `aws_credentials.md` appear to be expired or invalid:
- Error: "The security token included in the request is invalid"
- Error: "The provided token is malformed or otherwise invalid"

## AWS Credentials Information

From `aws_credentials.md`:
- **SSO Start URL**: https://cloudlab-urv.awsapps.com/start/#
- **SSO Region**: us-east-1
- **Account**: internship-sandbox (851725525148)
- **Permission Set**: cloudlab-permission-set

## Next Steps for AWS Execution

### Option 1: Get Fresh AWS SSO Credentials
1. Visit the SSO start URL: https://cloudlab-urv.awsapps.com/start/#
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Select the account: internship-sandbox (851725525148)
4. Choose the permission set: cloudlab-permission-set
5. Copy the new temporary credentials
6. Update the `config_aws.yaml` file with the new credentials

### Option 2: Configure AWS CLI SSO (Recommended)
```bash
# Install AWS CLI v2 (if not already installed)
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# Configure SSO
aws configure sso
# Use the following values when prompted:
# SSO start URL: https://cloudlab-urv.awsapps.com/start/#
# SSO Region: us-east-1
# Account: 851725525148
# Role: cloudlab-permission-set
```

### Option 3: Use Environment Variables
Export the fresh credentials as environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-new-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-new-secret-key"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your-new-session-token"
export LITHOPS_CONFIG_FILE=config_aws.yaml
```

## Current Configuration Files

- ‚úÖ `config_local.yaml` - Working local configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `config_aws.yaml` - AWS configuration with expired credentials
- üìÑ `aws_credentials.md` - Contains expired AWS credentials

## Execution Results (Local)

The Monte Carlo Pi estimation ran successfully with the following metrics:
- **Total Execution Time**: 128.77 seconds
- **Workers**: 10 (all completed successfully)
- **Average Compute Time**: 10.66 seconds per worker
- **Completion Rate**: 100%
- **Throughput**: 0.078 workers/second
- **Energy Monitoring**: Enabled with RAPL measurements

## Files Modified

1. **examples/montecarlo_pi_estimation/main.py**
   - Fixed hardcoded path for profiling output
   - Changed from absolute path to relative path

2. **config_aws.yaml**
   - Updated with credentials from aws_credentials.md (though they are expired)

## Recommendations

1. **For immediate testing**: Continue using the local configuration which works perfectly
2. **For AWS deployment**: Obtain fresh AWS credentials using one of the methods above
3. **For production**: Set up AWS CLI SSO for automatic credential refresh

The FlexExecutor framework is working correctly and ready for both local and cloud execution once fresh AWS credentials are obtained.
