### Technical Objectives

#### Primary Objective

#### Mathematical Foundation
```
π ≈ 4 × (points_inside_circle / total_points)
```

#### Implementation Details

#### Technical Specifications
```python
def monte_carlo_pi_estimation(ctx: StageContext) -> None:
    TOTAL_POINTS_TARGET = 100_000_000
    points_per_worker = TOTAL_POINTS_TARGET // ctx.num_workers
    samples_per_iteration = 100000
    
    # Statistical sampling loop
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        points_inside_circle = 0
        for _ in range(samples_per_iteration):
            x, y = random.random(), random.random()
            if x * x + y * y <= 1.0:
                points_inside_circle += 1
```
