/Users/arriazui/Desktop/GreenComputing/flexecutor-main/examples/general_usage/plot_generation/main_profiling_analysis.py look this example video_stage3_aws_512Mb_arm , by spliting by '_' you obtain first the example, in this case example=video, by the second you obtain the file_title=stage3, then you have the backend, wich can be aws or k8s if not should be NA, then the memory and by last one the architecture in arm or x86, if one of the fields from backend to the end is undefined, should be shown in the table as an error # Minimum Execution Summary
Minimum number of executions for each example by architecture and memory

|  x86 2048  |        |        |   3    |   8    |


for example for the case of the previous table 
| video_stage3_processing      | NA   | 512    | 16      | 1        |
| video_stage3_processing      | NA   | 512    | 20      | 1        |
| video_stage3_processing      | NA   | 512    | 24      | 1        |
| video_stage3_processing      | NA   | 512    | 28      | 1        |

the result in the minimal table should be

# Prompt TFG: 

Act as a writer and editor, my role is to help shape the narrative, strengthen the arguments, and ensure the final text is as clear, compelling, and professional as possible. 

The TFM is : /Users/arriazui/Desktop/GreenComputing/flexecutor-main/AAA_information/TFM_3_Measuring_and_Characterizing_Energy_Consumtion.md
 
is based in the current project 
brief summary : 
flexecutor is a wrapper of lithops ( /Users/arriazui/Desktop/GreenComputing/flexecutor-main/lithops_fork)
- in lithops i implemented the energy manager and its dependencies
- flexecutor i include the calculus metrics 


That is my code and what you can include as a literal code 

now following this advise /Users/arriazui/Desktop/GreenComputing/flexecutor-main/AAA_information/1 Feedback on TFM Energy Modules.md, could you add / rewrite the tesis 


# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Statistical 
You need to finalize the resulsts of a tfm that is here : /Users/arriazui/Desktop/GreenComputing/flexecutor-main/AAA_information/TFM_3_Measuring_and_Characterizing_Energy_Consumtion_ENHANCED.md 
Act as an statistic and analyze the /Users/arriazui/Desktop/GreenComputing/flexecutor-main/examples/general_usage/plot_generation/analysis_results

The files inside that folder follow the next structure: 
 video_stage3_aws_512Mb_arm , by spliting by '_'  you obtain first the example, in this case example=video, by the second you obtain the file_title=stage3, then you have the backend, wich can be aws or k8s if not should be NA, then the memory and by last one the architecture in arm or x86,


The content of the archives always follow the same structure, 
what would you analyze ? 
some of the possibles dimension compartison between : 
- time 
- cost in aws  
- energy cost
- memory  (512 / 1024 / 2048)
- architecture ( x86 vs arm )
- number of workers 

- anything else ? 

Give me the most meaninful comparison with the data that you have 
and suggest me the most important areas to do the comparison to be written in Markdown in the following section of the TFM
