# Measuring and Characterizing Energy Consumption in Serverless Workflows

## Introduction

The rapid adoption of serverless computing has transformed how we design and deploy distributed applications, offering unprecedented scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, this paradigm shift has introduced new challenges in understanding and optimizing energy consumption patterns. Traditional energy monitoring approaches, designed for static server environments, fall short when applied to the dynamic, ephemeral nature of serverless functions.

This work presents a comprehensive framework for measuring and characterizing energy consumption in serverless workflows, built upon the Lithops serverless computing framework and enhanced through the FlexExecutor orchestration layer. Our approach addresses the fundamental challenge of energy visibility in serverless environments, where functions execute across heterogeneous infrastructure with varying performance characteristics and energy profiles.

The increasing focus on sustainable computing practices, driven by both environmental concerns and operational costs, makes energy-aware serverless computing a critical research area. Current serverless platforms provide limited visibility into energy consumption, making it difficult for developers to optimize their applications for energy efficiency. Our framework bridges this gap by providing detailed energy metrics across multiple measurement methodologies and execution environments.

We demonstrate our approach through comprehensive experiments across different workload types, including Monte Carlo simulations, machine learning pipelines, video processing tasks, and data analytics workflows. These experiments reveal significant variations in energy consumption patterns based on parallelization strategies, resource allocation, and underlying hardware architectures, providing actionable insights for energy-efficient serverless application design.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this implementation is to develop a comprehensive energy monitoring and characterization system for serverless workflows that enables:

**Energy Visibility**: Provide detailed, real-time energy consumption metrics for serverless functions across multiple measurement methodologies, including RAPL (Running Average Power Limit), PERF counters, eBPF-based monitoring, and system-level metrics through PSUtil.

**Multi-Backend Support**: Ensure consistent energy monitoring capabilities across diverse execution environments, including local development environments, Kubernetes clusters, and cloud serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, enabling comparative analysis across different infrastructure types.

**Workload Characterization**: Enable systematic analysis of energy consumption patterns across different application types and parallelization strategies, providing insights into optimal resource allocation for energy efficiency.

**Performance-Energy Trade-off Analysis**: Facilitate comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between execution performance and energy consumption, enabling developers to make informed decisions about resource provisioning and optimization strategies.

**Scalable Integration**: Implement energy monitoring capabilities as a non-intrusive extension to existing serverless frameworks, ensuring minimal performance overhead and seamless integration with current development workflows.

## Context and Technologies

### Core Framework Architecture

Our implementation builds upon **Lithops**, a multi-cloud serverless computing framework that provides a unified interface for executing functions across different cloud providers and execution environments. Lithops serves as the foundation for our energy monitoring system, offering the necessary abstractions for function execution, data management, and result aggregation.

**FlexExecutor** acts as an orchestration layer above Lithops, providing DAG-based workflow management and enhanced profiling capabilities. This framework enables complex workflow execution with dependency management, resource optimization, and comprehensive performance monitoring, making it an ideal platform for integrating energy measurement capabilities.

### Energy Measurement Technologies

#### RAPL (Running Average Power Limit)
RAPL provides hardware-level energy consumption data directly from Intel processors, offering measurements for different power domains including package-level and core-level energy consumption. Our implementation accesses RAPL data through the Linux sysfs interface, providing high-precision energy measurements with minimal overhead.

#### PERF Counters
The Linux perf subsystem offers detailed performance counters including energy-related metrics. Our implementation leverages perf events to capture energy consumption data alongside performance metrics, providing correlated analysis of energy and execution characteristics.

#### eBPF-based Monitoring
Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology enables kernel-level monitoring with minimal performance impact. Our eBPF implementation captures energy-related events and CPU cycle counts, providing fine-grained visibility into function execution patterns.

#### PSUtil System Monitoring
PSUtil provides cross-platform system and process monitoring capabilities, offering CPU utilization, memory usage, and system-level metrics that complement hardware-specific energy measurements.

### Architecture Support

Our implementation supports both **x86-64** and **ARM64** architectures, with architecture-specific optimizations for energy measurement accuracy. The system automatically detects the underlying processor architecture and selects appropriate measurement methodologies based on hardware capabilities.

**x86-64 Architecture**: Full support for RAPL, PERF, and eBPF-based measurements, leveraging Intel's comprehensive power management features.

## Design and Implementation

### Energy Monitoring Architecture

The energy monitoring system follows a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly with the existing Lithops execution flow. The implementation consists of several key components:

#### Energy Manager Integration

The core energy monitoring functionality is implemented through modifications to the Lithops worker execution pipeline. The `handler.py` module, which manages function execution within workers, has been enhanced to initialize and coordinate energy monitoring across multiple measurement methods.

```python
# Energy monitoring initialization in handler.py
energy_manager = EnergyManager()
energy_manager.start_monitoring()

# Function execution with energy tracking
result = execute_user_function(func, data)

# Energy data collection
energy_metrics = energy_manager.stop_monitoring()
call_status.add_energy_metrics(energy_metrics)
```

#### Data Structure Enhancements

The `FunctionTimes` dataclass in `flexecutor/utils/dataclass.py` has been extended to capture comprehensive energy metrics:

```python
@dataclass
class FunctionTimes:
    # Traditional timing metrics
    read: Optional[float] = None
    compute: Optional[float] = None
    write: Optional[float] = None
    cold_start: Optional[float] = None
    
    # Energy metrics by measurement method
    perf_energy_cores: Optional[float] = None
    rapl_energy_cores: Optional[float] = None
    ebpf_energy_cores: Optional[float] = None
    psutil_cpu_percent: Optional[float] = None
    
    # Hardware information
    cpu_name: Optional[str] = None
    cpu_architecture: Optional[str] = None
    cpu_cores_physical: Optional[int] = None
    cpu_cores_logical: Optional[int] = None
    
    # AWS-specific information
    aws_cpu: Optional[str] = None
```

#### Result Aggregation and Storage

The `stagefuture.py` module handles the extraction and aggregation of energy metrics from worker statistics, mapping raw measurement data to structured energy profiles:

```python
def get_timings(self) -> List[FunctionTimes]:
    """Extract comprehensive timing and energy data from worker statistics."""
    for result, stats in zip(self._timings_list(), self.stats):
        # Extract energy metrics from different measurement methods
        result.perf_energy_cores = stats.get("worker_func_perf_energy_cores", 0.0)
        result.rapl_energy_cores = stats.get("worker_func_rapl_energy_cores", 0.0)
        result.ebpf_energy_cores = stats.get("worker_func_ebpf_energy_cores", 0.0)
        
        # Calculate derived metrics
        result.TDP = result.worker_time_execution * (cpu_percent / 100.0)
```

### Multi-Method Energy Measurement

#### RAPL Implementation

RAPL measurements are implemented through direct access to the Linux sysfs interface, providing package-level and core-level energy consumption data:

```python
def read_rapl_energy():
    """Read RAPL energy consumption from sysfs interface."""
    package_energy = read_sysfs_value("/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj")
    cores_energy = read_sysfs_value("/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:0/intel-rapl:0:0/energy_uj")
    return package_energy, cores_energy
```

#### PERF Counter Integration

PERF counters are accessed through the Linux perf_event_open system call, enabling hardware performance counter monitoring with energy correlation:

```python
def setup_perf_monitoring():
    """Initialize PERF counters for energy monitoring."""
    energy_events = [
        "power/energy-pkg/",
        "power/energy-cores/",
        "cpu-cycles",
        "instructions"
    ]
    return initialize_perf_events(energy_events)
```

#### eBPF-based Monitoring

eBPF programs are deployed to capture kernel-level events related to energy consumption and CPU utilization:

```c
// eBPF program for energy event capture
SEC("tracepoint/power/cpu_frequency")
int trace_cpu_frequency(struct trace_event_raw_cpu *ctx) {
    u64 timestamp = bpf_ktime_get_ns();
    u32 cpu = ctx->cpu_id;
    u32 frequency = ctx->state;
    
    // Store frequency change event
    struct energy_event event = {
        .timestamp = timestamp,
        .cpu = cpu,
        .frequency = frequency
    };
    
    bpf_perf_event_output(ctx, &energy_events, BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU, &event, sizeof(event));
    return 0;
}
```

### Backend-Specific Implementations

#### Localhost Backend

The localhost backend provides the most comprehensive energy monitoring capabilities, with direct access to hardware interfaces and system-level monitoring tools. This environment serves as the reference implementation for energy measurement accuracy and methodology validation.

#### Kubernetes Backend

Kubernetes deployments require containerized energy monitoring solutions that work within the constraints of container isolation. Our implementation uses privileged containers with host system access for hardware-level energy measurements, while providing fallback mechanisms for restricted environments.

#### AWS Lambda Backend

AWS Lambda presents unique challenges for energy monitoring due to the managed nature of the execution environment. Our implementation focuses on indirect energy estimation through CPU utilization metrics and execution time correlation, supplemented by AWS-specific instance information for energy modeling.

```python
def extract_aws_energy_info(stats):
    """Extract AWS-specific information for energy estimation."""
    instance_type = stats.get("worker_func_aws_instance_type", "Unknown")
    architecture = stats.get("worker_func_aws_architecture", "Unknown")
    memory_size = stats.get("worker_func_aws_memory_size", "unknown")
    
    return f"type:{instance_type}|arch:{architecture}|mem:{memory_size}"
```

## Different Methods of Energy Measurement

### Hardware-Level Measurements

#### RAPL (Running Average Power Limit)

RAPL provides the most accurate hardware-level energy measurements available on Intel processors. Our implementation accesses RAPL data through multiple interfaces:

**Package Energy**: Total energy consumption for the entire processor package, including cores, integrated graphics, and memory controller.

**Core Energy**: Energy consumption specifically attributed to CPU cores, excluding other package components.

**DRAM Energy**: Memory subsystem energy consumption (available on supported platforms).

The RAPL implementation includes automatic calibration and drift correction to ensure measurement accuracy across extended monitoring periods:

```python
class RAPLMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.baseline_energy = self.read_rapl_counters()
        self.calibration_factor = self.calculate_calibration()
    
    def get_energy_consumption(self):
        current_energy = self.read_rapl_counters()
        raw_consumption = current_energy - self.baseline_energy
        return raw_consumption * self.calibration_factor
```

#### PERF Energy Counters

PERF counters provide complementary energy measurements with high temporal resolution. Our implementation correlates PERF energy events with performance metrics to provide comprehensive energy-performance analysis:

**Energy-Package**: Package-level energy consumption through PERF events
**Energy-Cores**: Core-specific energy measurements
**CPU-Cycles**: Processor cycle counts for energy efficiency calculation
**Instructions**: Instruction counts for energy per operation analysis

#### eBPF-Based Monitoring

eBPF enables kernel-level energy event capture with minimal overhead. Our implementation deploys eBPF programs to monitor:

**CPU Frequency Changes**: Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling events
**Power State Transitions**: C-state and P-state changes
**Thermal Events**: Temperature-related throttling and energy management

### System-Level Measurements

#### PSUtil Monitoring

PSUtil provides cross-platform system monitoring capabilities that complement hardware-specific measurements:

**CPU Utilization**: Per-core and aggregate CPU usage percentages
**Memory Usage**: Physical and virtual memory consumption
**Process Statistics**: Per-process resource utilization
**System Load**: Overall system performance metrics

#### TDP-Based Estimation

For environments where hardware-level measurements are unavailable, our implementation provides TDP (Thermal Design Power) based energy estimation:

```python
def calculate_tdp_energy(cpu_percent, execution_time, tdp_watts):
    """Calculate energy consumption based on TDP and CPU utilization."""
    power_consumption = tdp_watts * (cpu_percent / 100.0)
    energy_joules = power_consumption * execution_time
    return energy_joules
```

### Measurement Validation and Correlation

Our implementation includes comprehensive validation mechanisms to ensure measurement accuracy and consistency across different methods:

#### Cross-Method Validation

Energy measurements from different methods are continuously compared to identify discrepancies and ensure data quality:

```python
def validate_energy_measurements(rapl_energy, perf_energy, estimated_energy):
    """Validate energy measurements across different methods."""
    tolerance = 0.15  # 15% tolerance
    
    if abs(rapl_energy - perf_energy) / rapl_energy > tolerance:
        logger.warning(f"RAPL/PERF energy discrepancy: {rapl_energy} vs {perf_energy}")
    
    return {
        'rapl': rapl_energy,
        'perf': perf_energy,
        'estimated': estimated_energy,
        'validated': True
    }
```

#### Temporal Correlation

Energy measurements are temporally correlated with execution phases to provide detailed energy attribution:

```python
def correlate_energy_with_execution_phases(energy_timeline, execution_phases):
    """Correlate energy consumption with specific execution phases."""
    phase_energy = {}
    
    for phase_name, (start_time, end_time) in execution_phases.items():
        phase_energy[phase_name] = integrate_energy_over_time(
            energy_timeline, start_time, end_time
        )
    
    return phase_energy
```

```python
def setup_k8s_energy_monitoring():
    """Setup energy monitoring in Kubernetes environment."""
    if os.path.exists('/sys/class/powercap'):
        # Direct hardware access available
        return HardwareEnergyMonitor()
    else:
        # Fallback to estimation-based monitoring
        return EstimationEnergyMonitor()
```

**Resource Attribution**: Correlate container-level resource usage with energy consumption
```python
def attribute_container_energy(container_stats, total_energy):
    """Attribute energy consumption to specific containers."""
    cpu_share = container_stats['cpu_usage'] / total_cpu_usage
    attributed_energy = total_energy * cpu_share
    return attributed_energy
```

### AWS Lambda Backend

class AWSLambdaEnergyEstimator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.instance_detector = AWSInstanceDetector()
        self.energy_models = self.load_energy_models()
    
    def estimate_energy_consumption(self, execution_stats):
        """Estimate energy consumption for AWS Lambda execution."""
        instance_info = self.instance_detector.detect_instance()
        cpu_utilization = execution_stats['cpu_percent']
        execution_time = execution_stats['duration']
        memory_size = execution_stats['memory_mb']
        
        # Select appropriate energy model
        model = self.energy_models[instance_info['processor_type']]
        
        # Calculate energy estimation
        base_power = model.get_base_power(memory_size)
        dynamic_power = model.get_dynamic_power(cpu_utilization)
        total_energy = (base_power + dynamic_power) * execution_time
        
        return {
            'estimated_energy': total_energy,
            'confidence': model.get_confidence_level(),
            'method': 'tdp_based_estimation',
            'instance_info': instance_info
        }
```

#### AWS Instance Detection

Accurate energy estimation requires identification of the underlying AWS infrastructure:

```python
def detect_aws_instance_info():
    """Detect AWS instance information for energy modeling."""
    try:
        # Query AWS metadata service
        metadata = requests.get(
            'http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type',
            timeout=1
        ).text
        
        # Determine processor architecture
        architecture = detect_processor_architecture()
        
        # Check if running in Lambda environment
        is_lambda = 'AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME' in os.environ
        
        return {
            'instance_type': metadata if not is_lambda else 'lambda',
            'architecture': architecture,
            'is_lambda': is_lambda,
            'memory_size': os.environ.get('AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE', 'unknown')
        }
    except:
        return {'instance_type': 'unknown', 'architecture': 'unknown'}
```
