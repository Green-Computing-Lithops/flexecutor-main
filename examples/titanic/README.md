# Titanic Survival Prediction: Machine Learning Workflow and Performance Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic survival prediction implementation using the FlexExecutor framework. The analysis covers the machine learning workflow, distributed execution methodology, and detailed performance metrics across different worker configurations processing the famous Titanic dataset.

## Machine Learning Workflow

### Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including:

- **Passenger Class (Pclass)**: Socio-economic status (1st, 2nd, 3rd class)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Survived**: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

### Synthetic Test Datasets

The implementation has been tested with synthetic datasets of varying sizes to evaluate scalability:

- **6MB Dataset** (`titanic_6Mb.csv`): ~89,100 records
  - Generated by replicating and augmenting the original Titanic dataset
  - File size: 6.1MB
  - Used for testing moderate-scale distributed processing

- **60MB Dataset** (`titanic_60Mb.csv`): ~891,000 records  
  - Large-scale synthetic dataset with 10× more records than the 6MB version
  - File size: 62MB
  - Used for testing high-throughput distributed machine learning workflows

Both synthetic datasets maintain the original Titanic schema and feature distributions while providing larger sample sizes to better evaluate the distributed processing capabilities and energy efficiency across different worker configurations.

### Algorithm Implementation

The implementation uses a **Random Forest Classifier** for survival prediction:

```python
def train_model(ctx: StageContext) -> None:
    # Load and preprocess data chunk
    chunk = pd.read_csv(chunk_path)
    features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare"]
    chunk = chunk.dropna(subset=features + ["Survived"])
    
    # Feature engineering
    X = chunk[features]
    X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=["Sex"], drop_first=True)
    y = chunk["Survived"]
    
    # Train-test split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    
    # Model training
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluation
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
```

### Distributed Processing Strategy

The implementation supports two chunking strategies:

1. **Static Chunking**: Pre-defined data splits using `chunking_static_csv`
2. **Dynamic Chunking**: Adaptive data partitioning using `chunking_dynamic_csv`

Each worker processes a chunk of the dataset independently, training a Random Forest model and evaluating its accuracy on a held-out test set.

### Dataset Size Impact

The performance analysis covers testing with multiple dataset sizes:

- **6MB Dataset Performance**: Results shown in the table above and Figure 1
- **60MB Dataset Performance**: Additional testing performed with 10× larger dataset (891,000 records)
- **Scalability Validation**: Both datasets demonstrate similar scalability patterns with proportional increases in execution time and energy consumption

## Key Performance Insights

### 1. Execution Time Scaling

The execution time demonstrates good scalability with diminishing returns:

- **8 Workers**: 15.96 seconds average compute time
- **16 Workers**: 8.84 seconds (1.8× speedup)
- **28 Workers**: 6.22 seconds (2.6× total speedup)

**Analysis**: The algorithm shows sublinear scaling due to the overhead of data loading, preprocessing, and model training on smaller chunks. The machine learning workload is less parallelizable than pure computational tasks.

### 2. Energy Consumption Patterns

#### RAPL Energy (Actual CPU Energy Consumption)
- **Anomaly at 8 Workers**: Negative RAPL values (-118.66J) indicate measurement issues
- **Stable Range**: 983-1218J per worker for 9+ workers
- **Total Energy**: Generally decreases with more workers (10.9kJ to 5.9kJ)

#### TDP Energy (Theoretical Design Power)
- **Per Worker Average**: Relatively stable around 300-430J
- **Total Energy**: Decreases with more workers (3.4kJ to 1.6kJ)
- **Efficiency**: Better resource utilization with higher worker counts

### 3. Machine Learning Efficiency Analysis

The **TDP/RAPL ratio** (excluding anomalous 8-worker data) shows:

- **Consistent Range**: 0.267-0.360 across configurations
- **Optimal Range**: 12-16 workers show best efficiency ratios
- **Interpretation**: Approximately 27-36% of theoretical CPU power utilized

### 4. Model Accuracy Considerations

Each worker trains on a different data chunk, which may result in:
- **Variation in Accuracy**: Different chunks may have varying prediction difficulty
- **Ensemble Potential**: Multiple models could be combined for improved performance
- **Data Distribution**: Chunk quality affects individual model performance

## Recommendations

### Optimal Configuration Analysis

Based on the performance data:

1. **For Speed**: 24-28 workers provide fastest execution (6-7 seconds)
2. **For Energy Efficiency**: 16-20 workers offer good balance of speed and energy consumption
3. **For Resource Utilization**: 12-16 workers show optimal TDP/RAPL ratios

### Use Case Recommendations

- **Real-time Prediction**: Use 20+ workers for low-latency inference
- **Batch Processing**: Use 12-16 workers for optimal efficiency
- **Research/Development**: Use 8-12 workers for cost-effective experimentation

### Data Processing Considerations

- **Chunk Size**: Optimize chunk size for your dataset to balance load distribution
- **Feature Engineering**: Consider distributed feature engineering for larger datasets
- **Model Ensemble**: Combine predictions from multiple workers for improved accuracy

## Conclusion

The Titanic survival prediction implementation demonstrates effective distributed machine learning using FlexExecutor.

The system provides a solid foundation for distributed machine learning workflows with comprehensive monitoring and flexible data processing capabilities.

The results indicate that machine learning workloads benefit from moderate parallelization, with diminishing returns beyond 20-24 workers due to overhead costs and data chunk size limitations. The implementation serves as an excellent template for distributed classification tasks on tabular data.
